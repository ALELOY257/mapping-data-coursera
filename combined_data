The nose has the freshness of wild little flowers, violets and roses, plus earthy notes, which have the depth and the delicate strengths of ripe fruit, with wild strawberries, cherries and plums, and with a finish of red orange and tamarind. The palate is voracious: the natural minerality of the soil increase the perception of the smooth body on the palate, with dense but silky tannins and hints of leather and pepper. A little masterpiece of classicism, withthe typical characteristics and lightness of Sangiovese, almost anethereal floral and fruity structure with gentle tannins and licorice notes. "
